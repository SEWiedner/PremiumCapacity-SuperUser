Power BI Premium provides resources dedicated to running the Power BI service for your organization or team, giving you more dependable performance and larger data volumes. 
Premium also enables widespread distribution of content without requiring you to purchase per-user licenses for viewers.

You can take advantage of Power BI Premium by assigning workspaces to a Premium capacity. 
Premium capacity is a dedicated resource for your organization. 
For workspaces that are not assigned to a premium capacity, these will be in a shared capacity.

Shared capacity is the experience you are used to with Power BI, where your workloads run on computational resources shared by other customers. 
In shared capacity, more limits are placed on individual users to ensure quality of the experience for all users.

-Items within a Premium capacity
Accessing app workspaces (as members or admins) and publishing apps requires a Power BI Pro license.
Sharing an app requires a Pro license, but consuming an app doesn't.
All dashboard recipients, regardless of the license they're assigned, can set data alerts.
REST APIs for embedding use a service account with a Pro license, rather than a user account.

-My workspace in Shared capacity
Sharing and consuming an app both require a Pro license.

-App workspaces in Shared capacity
Any app usage requires a Pro license.
