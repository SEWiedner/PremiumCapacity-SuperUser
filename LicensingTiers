There are two types of capacity within Power BI. Shared capacity and Power BI Premium capacity. 

*Premium capacity
To start using a Power BI Premium capacity, you need to assign a workspace to a capacity. 

When a workspace is backed by premium capacity, you enjoy the benefits of Power BI Premium.

-Scheduled refreshes: users prior were limited to 8x a day when scheduling refreshes with imported models. 
This limitation is lifted for datasets in Premium workspaces. 
This does not apply to the scheduled cache refresh settings for DirectQuery. Those remain the same between Premium and Shared capacities.

-Isolation with dedicated hardware â€“ by nature of shared capacity, the performance of your reports and dashboards may be impacted by the resource demands of other workloads in the capacity, despite our safeguards against it. 
Conversely, Premium provides more consistent, dependable performance for your workloads by isolating it from unrelated workloads.
If an app is backed by premium capacity (i.e. it was published from an app workspace that is currently assigned to Premium), the published app can then be used by any user in your organization regardless of the license they are assigned.

*Shared capacity
By default, your workspace will be in shared capacity. This includes your personal My workspace along with App workspaces. A Shared capacity is the experience you are used to with Power BI, where your workloads run on computational resources shared by other customers.
